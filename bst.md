# Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values. In an inorder traversal, we first visit the left subtree of a node, then visit the node itself, and finally visit the right subtree of the node
[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

# Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal is a tree traversal algorithm that visits the root node first, then recursively visits the left subtree and then the right subtree.
[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

# Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal is a tree traversal algorithm that visits each node in the tree in the following order: root node, left subtree, right subtree
[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


# Same Tree
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false


# Balanced BST
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced. A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.
[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: true
