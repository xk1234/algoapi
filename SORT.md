# Insertion Sort
In Insertion sort, you compare the key element with the previous elements. If the previous elements are greater than the key element, then you move the previous element to the next position.


# Counting sort

The counting sort algorithm works by first creating a list of the counts or occurrences of each unique value in the list. It then creates a final sorted list based on the list of counts.
